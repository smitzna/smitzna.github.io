Although this post is about a puzzle at first glance, it really is about the joy of learning. When I was a kid (fourth grade if I remember correctly), my parents gave me a triangular shape puzzle (see Fig.1 below). The puzzle itself is not difficult, but then I realized some interesting patterns related to it.

One pattern that is quite obvious is that the number of pieces at each level is always an odd number. Another pattern that is less obvious is that the total number of of pieces from level 1 to level $$n$$ is always a quadratic number. Hence, we got the following relationship\
1 = 1\
1 + 3 = 4\
1 + 3 + 5 = 9\
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16\
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25\
and so on. This means the summation of all positive odd numbers from the smallest one (1) to the $$n^\mathrm{th}$$ one is equal to $$n^2$$. In other words, $$\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (2i-1) = n^2$$.

As a kid, finding this relationship feels exhilarating. But then, I remember that somebody (probably my parents) asked, "How do you prove that?". And that's where it got interesting, especially because I haven't been taught about how to sum sequence in the fourth grade. I spent several days before I made a connection between this problem and the area of a trapezoid, and then use the trapezoid area formula to kind of "proving" this relationship.

The reasoning goes like this. The triangle itself is a trapezoid with the top part's length equal to zero. Hence, the total number of pieces is analogous with the area of a trapezoid. The area of a trapezoid can be obtained by multiplying its height with the average length of its top and bottom parts. Likewise, the total number of pieces is the height (level, $$n$$) times the average of the number of pieces at the top (1) and at the bottom ($$2n-1$$). This is equal to $$= \frac{(1+2n-1)}{2}n = n^2$$. That concludes the proof. Of course, it is not a rigorous proof, but, at that time, I felt satisfied with it.

After realizing that an area is analogous with a summation, I asked my father what an area really is. As what is normal in my family, he did not give me any answer. Instead, he encouraged me to think about it myself. After thinking about it for some time, I asked him again what a length really is and obtained the same response. Eventually, after a few days, I went to him and said that a length is the number of points in a line, and an area is the number of points in a space bounded by lines. That is my first encounter with the concept of calculus.

When I look back on this memory, I cannot but admire my parents. Their action (and the lack of it) is what makes the fourth-grade me kept asking questions and tried to solve them himself. They taught me the joy of learning. That feeling of getting just a drop of understanding is really addictive. Once you experience it, you want more, even if it costs you a lot of effort.
