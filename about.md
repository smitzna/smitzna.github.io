Hi there. First of all, we want to emphasize that this website **is not** about gardening. So if you are looking for something about gardening, you may or may not find it to your liking.

Just kidding :smile:. You see, this *garden* is where we play around and write whatever we want to write. Of course, we will do our best to not offend anyone and to write something that we think will be useful for the reader. But, it is, first and foremost, our garden.

The *flowers* in this garden may belong to the class of science, coding, law, language, cooking, and tips on how to toilet-train your kids (taxonomically, this last one should be a species instead of a class ...probably). They may be originated from Indonesia, Arabic-speaking, or English-speaking countries. The wide range of variation reflects the fact that the gardeners have quite different backgrounds.

So, hopefully, you will enjoy our garden.
